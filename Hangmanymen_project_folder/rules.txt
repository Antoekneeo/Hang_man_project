Hangman Game Rules
Welcome to Hangman! This is a word-guessing game where you try to figure out a hidden word letter by letter before the hangman is complete.
How to Play:

Choose a difficulty level:

Easy: shorter, common words
Medium: longer, everyday words
Hard: challenging, less common words
Custom: play with your own custom word list


Guess letters or the whole word:

Type a single letter to guess if it's in the word
Type the entire word if you think you know it


Scoring system:

You start with 100 points
+10 points for each correct letter
-10 points for each wrong guess (letter or word)
Bonus points when guessing the full word (+10 per each unguessed letter)
Using a hint costs 5 points


Hints:

When you have 3 lives remaining, you can request a hint
A hint will reveal one letter that you haven't guessed yet


Game Over:
